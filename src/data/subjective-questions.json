      "answer": "OOP can model real-world problems by using objects that represent real-world entities, encapsulating data and behavior, and promoting code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism.\nCritics of OOP argue that it can lead to overly complex code, is not always the best fit for all types of problems, and can result in performance overhead due to abstraction layers."

      "answer": "Limitations of genetic algorithms include the need for a large number of evaluations, difficulty in finding the exact global optimum, and the possibility of premature convergence.\nAn AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. A binary tree becomes an AVL tree when it satisfies this balance condition.\nTo find the sequence of edges added using Kruskal's algorithm, sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their weight, and add edges to the spanning tree one by one, ensuring no cycles are formed."

Each refresh operation requires 150 ns; a memory cycle requires 250 ns. What percentage of the memory’s total operating time must be given to refreshes?\nIn the context of RAID, what is the distinction between parallel access and independent access?",
      "answer": "RAMs are organized as one bit per chip to simplify design and reduce cost, while ROMs can afford complexity for higher density.\nPercentage for refresh = (64 * 150 ns) / (1000 * 1000 ns) * 100 = 9.6%\nParallel access allows simultaneous data access, while independent access allows separate data access without interference."
